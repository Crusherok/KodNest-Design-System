Create a premium SaaS design system called "KodNest Premium Build System".

This is not a student project. This must feel like a serious B2C product company.

DESIGN PHILOSOPHY:
- Calm, Intentional, Coherent, Confident
- Not flashy, not loud, not playful, not hackathon-style
- No gradients, no glassmorphism, no neon colors, no animation noise

COLOR SYSTEM:
- Background: #F7F6F3 (off-white)
- Primary text: #111111
- Accent: #8B0000 (deep red)
- Success: muted green
- Warning: muted amber
- Use maximum 4 colors across entire system

TYPOGRAPHY:
- Headings: Serif font, large, confident, generous spacing
- Body: Clean sans-serif, 16–18px, line-height 1.6–1.8, max 720px for text blocks
- No decorative fonts, no random sizes

SPACING SYSTEM (consistent scale):
8px, 16px, 24px, 40px, 64px
Never use random spacing like 13px, 27px, etc. Whitespace is part of design.

GLOBAL LAYOUT STRUCTURE:
Every page must follow: [Top Bar] → [Context Header] → [Primary Workspace + Secondary Panel] → [Proof Footer]

TOP BAR:
- Left: Project name
- Center: Progress indicator (Step X / Y)
- Right: Status badge (Not Started / In Progress / Shipped)

CONTEXT HEADER:
- Large serif headline, 1-line subtext, clear purpose, no hype language

PRIMARY WORKSPACE (70% width):
- Where the main product interaction happens
- Clean cards, predictable components, no crowding

SECONDARY PANEL (30% width):
- Step explanation (short)
- Copyable prompt box
- Buttons: Copy, Build in Lovable, It Worked, Error, Add Screenshot
- Calm styling

PROOF FOOTER (persistent bottom section):
Checklist style: □ UI Built □ Logic Working □ Test Passed □ Deployed
Each checkbox requires user proof input.

COMPONENT RULES:
- Primary button = solid deep red, Secondary = outlined
- Same hover effect and border radius everywhere
- Inputs: clean borders, no heavy shadows, clear focus state
- Cards: subtle border, no drop shadows, balanced padding

INTERACTION RULES:
- Transitions: 150–200ms, ease-in-out, no bounce, no parallax

ERROR & EMPTY STATES:
- Errors: explain what went wrong + how to fix, never blame user
- Empty states: provide next action, never feel dead

Everything must feel like one mind designed it. No visual drift. Return confirmation once design system is created. Do NOT add product features yet.


Create a Placement Readiness Platform application with React, Tailwind CSS, and React Router.

1. Build a landing page with:
   - A hero section: heading "Ace Your Placement", subheading "Practice, assess, and prepare for your dream job", and a "Get Started" button
   - A features grid (3 columns) with cards: "Practice Problems" (with code icon), "Mock Interviews" (with video icon), "Track Progress" (with chart icon). Each card has a title and one-line description.
   - A footer with copyright text

2. Create an app shell for the dashboard area with:
   - Sidebar navigation with links: Dashboard, Practice, Assessments, Resources, Profile
   - Use lucide-react icons for each nav item
   - A header showing "Placement Prep" and a user avatar placeholder
   - Main content area with <Outlet />

3. Use an indigo/purple color scheme — primary: hsl(245, 58%, 51%).

4. Make the "Get Started" button navigate to the Dashboard page. Create placeholder pages for each route.

Build the Dashboard page with the following components:

1. "Overall Readiness" — a large circular progress indicator showing 72/100. Use a custom SVG circle with stroke-dasharray animation. Show the number in the center with "Readiness Score" label below.

2. "Skill Breakdown" — a radar chart using recharts with 5 axes: DSA (75), System Design (60), Communication (80), Resume (85), Aptitude (70). Use ResponsiveContainer.

3. "Continue Practice" — a card showing the last topic: "Dynamic Programming", with a progress bar (3/10 completed) and a "Continue" button.

4. "Weekly Goals" — show "Problems Solved: 12/20 this week" with a progress bar. Below it, show 7 small day circles (Mon-Sun), filled for days with activity.

5. "Upcoming Assessments" — a list of 3 items:
   - "DSA Mock Test" — Tomorrow, 10:00 AM
   - "System Design Review" — Wed, 2:00 PM
   - "HR Interview Prep" — Friday, 11:00 AM

Use shadcn/ui Card components. Layout: 2-column grid on desktop, single column on mobile. Use recharts for the radar chart with mock data.

Upgrade Placement Readiness Platform with REAL working analysis logic (still no external scraping).

NON-NEGOTIABLE:
- Do NOT change routes.
- Keep premium design.
- Persist history in localStorage.

1) Implement skill extraction (heuristic):

Detect keywords from JD text (case-insensitive) across categories:

Core CS:
DSA, OOP, DBMS, OS, Networks

Languages:
Java, Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, C, C++, C#, Go

Web:
React, Next.js, Node.js, Express, REST, GraphQL

Data:
SQL, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, MySQL, Redis

Cloud/DevOps:
AWS, Azure, GCP, Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD, Linux

Testing:
Selenium, Cypress, Playwright, JUnit, PyTest

If JD includes none, still show "General fresher stack".

2) Generate outputs from detected skills:

A) Key skills extracted
- show tags grouped by category

B) Round-wise preparation checklist (template-based):
- Round 1: Aptitude / Basics
- Round 2: DSA + Core CS
- Round 3: Tech interview (projects + stack)
- Round 4: Managerial / HR

Each round should list 5–8 checklist items based on skills detected.

C) 7-day plan:
Day 1–2: Basics + core CS
Day 3–4: DSA + coding practice
Day 5: Project + resume alignment
Day 6: Mock interview questions
Day 7: Revision + weak areas

Adapt the plan based on detected skills (e.g., React present → include frontend revision).

D) 10 likely interview questions:
Generate questions based on detected skills.
Example:
If SQL present → "Explain indexing and when it helps."
If React present → "Explain state management options."
If DSA present → "How would you optimize search in sorted data?"
Keep questions specific, not generic.

3) Readiness score (0–100):
Start 35.
+5 per detected category present (max 30).
+10 if company name provided.
+10 if role provided.
+10 if JD length > 800 chars.
Cap at 100.

4) Save to History:
On Analyze, store an entry in localStorage:
{
  id,
  createdAt,
  company,
  role,
  jdText,
  extractedSkills,
  plan,
  checklist,
  questions,
  readinessScore
}

History page:
- list entries with date + company + role + score
- clicking one opens /results with that saved entry

Results page must render latest analysis or selected history item.

No external APIs.
No scraping.
Everything must work offline and persist on refresh.

OUTPUT REQUIRED:
- Confirm skill extraction works
- Confirm history persists after refresh
- Provide steps to verify with a sample JD
